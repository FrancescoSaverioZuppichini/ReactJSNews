I would like to thank everybody that entered the giveaway. It was a lot harder than I thought it would be to choose a winner. I know that everyone who entered tried very hard. Before going into who won, here's a little recap of what was submitted.

**David Wells** wrote about [Isomorphic React](https://reactjsnews.com/isomorphic-javascript-with-react-node/) utilizing the power of node to keep consistent code on both the client and server.


**James Burnett** Submitted two articles, [Complex Drag and Drop in React](https://reactjsnews.com/complex-drag-and-drop-lists-using-react/) and [Setting up React with Rails and Jest](https://reactjsnews.com/setting-up-rails-for-react-and-jest/).

[**David Chang**](http://davidandsuzi.com/), who previously wrote the insanely popular [State of Flux](https://reactjsnews.com/the-state-of-flux/), submitted [React Style Guide](https://reactjsnews.com/react-style-guide-patterns-i-like/).

[**Jack Callister**](http://jackcallister.com/) wrote about [building a test suite in React](https://reactjsnews.com/building-a-test-suite-in-react-js/).

Only three people submitted, which made it even harder to choose a winner. When starting this giveaway I didn't really have a clear idea on how I was going to grade the articles. I ended up deciding that I should let whoever had the most influencial article win. Due to this, the winner is **David Chang**. His article on React style patterns, in a span of two days, holds over 35% of all pageviews on this site. It was also on the front page of [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com). 

##### Conclusion

I would just like to say thanks to all four of you for entering the giveaway. The community is better off with the guides you have each written!
