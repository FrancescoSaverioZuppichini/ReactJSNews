##ES6

With ES6 components, there are a few "aha" moments and annoyances. This post was created so that you don't have to go through some of the struggles myself and others have gone through.

**Function Bindings**

~~~js
<div onClick={this.handleClick} />
~~~

What's wrong with that? If you're not using `React.createClass`, which autobinds functions, you need to do it yourself. The correct way would be:

~~~js
<div onClick={this.handleClick.bind(this)} />
~~~

**Static Property Initializers**

In old-school components, you can do this at the start of your component:

~~~js
propTypes: {
  field: React.PropTypes.string
}
~~~

In ES6/7 components, you have two options, you can specify them after your component class, like so:

~~~js
Component.propTypes = {
  //prop validations
}
~~~

Which works fine, but I think doing this is a lot better:

~~~js
class Test extends React.Component{
  
  static propTypes = {
    //validate here
  }

 render(){
  //return
 } 
}
~~~

What's the "gotcha" you might ask? You need to enable **stage 0** babel transforms to use this.
