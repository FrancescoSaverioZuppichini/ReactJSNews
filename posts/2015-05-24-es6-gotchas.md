With ES6 components, there are a few "aha" moments and annoyances. This post was created so that you don't have to go through some of the struggles myself and others have gone through.

**Function Bindings**

~~~js
<div onClick={this.handleClick} />
~~~

What's wrong with that? If you're not using `React.createClass`, which autobinds functions, you need to do it yourself. The correct way would be add it to constructor:

~~~js
import React from 'react'

export default class ComponentName extends React.Component {
  constructor(){
    super()
    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this)
  }
  ...
~~~

Another way of dealing with this is by enabling stage 0 in babel to include [es7 classProperties](https://gist.github.com/jeffmo/054df782c05639da2adb)

**Warning**
Use with extreme caution.  Since this is [Stage 0 - Strawman](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/experimental/).  This is subject to change in the future and may require a bit of rewrite of your code.

The idea is to combine fat arrow syntax which automatically binds to this.  A more detailed explanation can be found [here](http://www.ian-thomas.net/autobinding-react-and-es6-classes/)

~~~js
export default class ComponentName extends React.Component {
  ...
  handleClick = (e) => {
    ...
  }
~~~

A common gotcha is to bind `this` in the render function, either by using `.bind(this)` or the `::` [ES7 bind](https://github.com/zenparsing/es-function-bind) syntax. Although this is a common practice, it breaks the optimization of the `PureRenderMixin` and will create new function to be created every time the `render()` method is called.

~~~js
export default class ComponentName extends React.Component {

  handleClick(e) {
    ...
  }
  
  render(){
    return (
      <button onClick={::this.handleClick}> click </button> 
    );
  }
}
~~~


**Static Property Initializers**

In old-school components, you can do this at the start of your component:

~~~js
propTypes: {
  field: React.PropTypes.string
}
~~~

In ES6/7 components, you have two options, you can specify them after your component class, like so:

~~~js
Component.propTypes = {
  //prop validations
}
~~~

Which works fine, but I think doing this is a lot better:

~~~js
class Test extends React.Component{

  static propTypes = {
    //validate here
  }

 render(){
  //return
 }
}
~~~

What's the "gotcha" you might ask? You need to enable **stage 0** babel transforms to use this.
