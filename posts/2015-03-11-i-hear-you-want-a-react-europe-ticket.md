The React Europe team has been kind enough to offer me two tickets. One for me to use, and another to giveaway. I'm excited about this conference, but I'm not 100% sure yet if I'll be going. Either way, someone will win a ticket. If I do end up being able to go, I'll be helping at the check in booth, so anyone who didn't see me at the first conference definitely would this time!

##The Details

I'm going to give it away similar to last time, but the criteria is going to be much simpler. Whichever article I consider to be the most influential and impactful will win. It's that simple. You can submit an article or video. It just has to be a minimum of 300 words and high quality. The video needs to be useful as well, obviously a two-second video won't be accepted. If you have any questions, leave a comment! You can send in your submissions to: zackify(at)gmail.com!

**Deadline:** May 1st
