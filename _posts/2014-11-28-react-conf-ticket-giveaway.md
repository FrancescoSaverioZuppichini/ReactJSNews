The first ever React conference is happening in January at Facebook's headquarters. The sad part is that the demand is so high, not everyone who wants to go will be able to. This is part of the reason I'll be giving away a ticket. The other reason is to create more tutorials and guides for the community. You're probably wondering what that has to do with a giveaway, but you're about to find out!

##The Details

There's a few small guidelines I have. If you're interested in getting a free ticket you need to do one of two things:

**Create a Blog Post**

-   Must be at least 300 words, excluding code examples
-   It has to be completely original
-   You must be okay with me posting it on this site, credit will be given to the author.

**Make a video**

If blogging isn't your thing, you have the option of creating a video tutorial.

-   It must be at least five minutes long
-   needs to have the source code available

##Conclusion

I hope to see everyone at the conference, so please try to make it out! Just to make sure everyone understands, this is only a giveaway for a ticket, not a flight, room, or anything else. You can submit your article or video to zackifyatgmail.com. They must be unique and not something you've already made.
