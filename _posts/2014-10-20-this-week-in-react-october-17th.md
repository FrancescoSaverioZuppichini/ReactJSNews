This is the first weekly roundup on ReactJS News! We've been busy working on making this site awesome for you guys, and it's coming along. Let's get started.

##React DnD
First off, we've got a [React Drag n' drop library](https://github.com/gaearon/react-dnd). I've had to make something like this at work, but this would have been so much easier to use. Creating a drop target with this mixin is very easy, as we can see from its documentation:

```js
var { DragDropMixin } = require('react-dnd'),
    ItemTypes = require('./ItemTypes');

var ImageBlock = React.createClass({
  mixins: [DragDropMixin],

  configureDragDrop(registerType) {

    registerType(ItemTypes.IMAGE, {

      // dropTarget, when specified, is { acceptDrop(item)?, canDrop(item)? enter(item)?, over(item)?, leave(item)? }
      dropTarget: {
        acceptDrop(image) {
          // Do something with image! for example,
          DocumentActionCreators.setImage(this.props.blockId, image);
        }
      }
    });
  },

  render() {

    // {...this.dropTargetFor(ItemTypes.IMAGE)} will expand into
    // { onDragEnter: (handled by mixin), onDragOver: (handled by mixin), onDragLeave: (handled by mixin), onDrop: (handled by mixin) }.

    return (
      <div {...this.dropTargetFor(ItemTypes.IMAGE)}>
        {this.props.image &&
          <img src={this.props.image.url} />
        }
      </div>
    );
  }
);
```

##Morearty.js
[Morearty.js](https://github.com/moreartyjs/moreartyjs) aims to help those who need more advanced state handling in React. What's cool is that component state is transferred to sub-components in a binding attribute and can be retrieved using a custom method. This can be really useful when you have two components interacting together. Creating states (contexts) in morearty is pretty simple: 

```js
var Ctx = Morearty.createContext(
  { // initial state
    nowShowing: 'all',
    items: [{
      title: 'My first task',
      completed: false,
      editing: false
    }]
  },
  { // configuration
    requestAnimationFrameEnabled: true
  }
);
```

Take a look at [the docs](https://github.com/moreartyjs/moreartyjs) for more information.

That's all that was sent in this week. I've been super busy trying to get our news section up and running. It's been hard since I just took on a second job.
