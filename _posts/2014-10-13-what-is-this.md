As some of you may know, ReactJS News started out as a hacker news type site focused on letting anyone post links to their latest React creations. A couple months back, I had to travel and didn't have internet access for a few months. During this time the server crashed, we were using a meteor app just by doing `meteor up`, pretty stupid, I know. Now that I'm back, myself and [Jorge](https://github.com/vasco3) are working on making this site more awesome than it ever was.

As some of you may know, ReactJS News started out as a hacker news type site focused on letting anyone post links to their latest React creations. A couple months back, I had to travel and didn't have internet access for a few months. During this time the server crashed, we were using a meteor app just by doing `meteor up`, pretty stupid, I know. Now that I'm back, myself and [Jorge](https://github.com/vasco3) are working on making this site more awesome than it ever was. 

##What's Coming
The new landing page is a dedicated blog running [Ghost](http://ghost.org). I plan to personally post a collection of the latest React news every week. I know that the official React blog ran by [@Vjeux](https://twitter.com/vjeux) also does this, but he's even told me he hardly has time to do it. I'm looking for more people interested in React to become a contributor. If anyone is interested, please tweet us [@ReactJSNews](http://twitter.com/ReactJSNews).
Next up, Jorge and I are working on a custom content management system built using React and Flux that will handle our community section. It's aimed to be just like Hacker News. You can star it on github and even help with the development if you're interested, the repo is [here](https://github.com/Legitcode/ReactJSNews). Since this site is running on a VM, we might add an IRC server, Minecraft, or something else if the community wants us to.

##Anything Else?
That's about it for now. I would like to feature some React video tutorials that people have made. I've also been thinking of making some myself. If you like this project, please follow us on Twitter or leave a comment with some suggestions!

Oh yeah, a simple logo for our sidebar would look nice :P
